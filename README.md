## Description
---
We both had the role of being Full-stack Developers for this project. For the frontend we used React and for backend we used Django. We decided to implement Django because it’s a framework neither of us were familiar with and didn’t learn in our bootcamp course, so we wanted to challenge ourselves and learn something new. Facing many challenges and issues, we had the opportunity to learn a lot through trial and error. A few of those issues that we found solutions to were coding with Python/Django and Git commands.

## Technologies

|  Frontend  | Backend   |
| :-------:  | :-------: |
| React      | Python    |
| Javascript | Django    |
| Material UI| db.sqlite3|
| Babel      |           |
| React-router-dom|      | 
| Webpack    |           |
